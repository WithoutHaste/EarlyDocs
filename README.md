# EarlyDocs

XML to MD documentation converter for Visual Studio XML documentation.

Instead of making a single .md file, it will generate a Contents file and one file per Type, and all the files will be saved in a "documentation" folder in the same directory as the XML file.

Goal is to make this into a tool that will run when a project is built, and can be installed as a NuGet package.

Work in progress
